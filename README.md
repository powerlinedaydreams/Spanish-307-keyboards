1. To install it, click the bright green "Code" button.
2. Select "Download ZIP" and save the file somewhere on your computer.
3. Unzip the file (if you're not sure how, go here: (https://www.wikihow.com/Unzip-a-File)).
4. Enter the folder that matches your system ("macOS" if you are on a Mac/Apple computer or "Windows" if your computer is made by anyone else).
5. Follow the instructions in the "instructions.txt" file.  (The instructions for the macOS version are a lot better, because that's my main system.  There's even a video that goes through the steps.  If you're on Windows and you're having trouble, just reach out to me.)
6. Start typing all those fun IPA/AFI symbols! [ˈas.taˈlu̯e.ɣo]
